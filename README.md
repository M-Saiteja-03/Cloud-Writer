• Developed a full-stack note-taking application using React for the frontend and Node.js, Express, and
MongoDB for the backend. It features robust security measures and a responsive user interface with
real-time validations , allowing users to create, edit, and manage notes seamlessly. <br />
• Security was prioritized by implementing several measures like authentication and authorization to
protect user data, implementing password hashing for secure storage, using environment variables to protect
sensitive information, and ensuring secure communication between the frontend and backend.
